      "1 Introduction\n",
      "Crosslinx Transit Solutions (CTS) has implemented a Cyber Security Plan (CSP) and associated policies and processes for protecting the Eglinton Crosstown Light Rail Transit (ECLRT’s) Cyber Systems from cyber security threats that could compromise the safe and reliable operation of the ECLRT.\n",
      "The CTS Cyber Security - Management Controls Policy, establishes the management controls and the framework for cyber security standards, plans and processes for securing those Cyber Systems that are essential for the safe and reliable operation of the ECLRT.\n",
      "The Cyber Security – Change Control and Configuration Management Standard, defined the cyber security controls and required processes for managing changes to ECLRT’s operational Cyber Systems and associated Cyber Assets and their configurations.\n",
      "This document presents the processes for implementing, sustaining, and adhering to the cyber security controls for managing and controlling changes to ECLRT’s Cyber Systems and changes to the baseline configurations for the applicable Cyber Assets.\n",
      "2 Purpose\n",
      "To present the processes, guidelines and roles and responsibilities for managing and controlling changes to ECLRT’s Cyber Systems and controlling and managing changes to the baseline configurations of their Cyber Assets and the associated cyber security controls.\n",
      "3 Objectives\n",
      "The objectives for this document are to establish the process and guidelines for the following:\n",
      "1. Developing the baseline configuration for ECLRT’s Cyber Assets\n",
      "2. The process for implementing, managing, and controlling changes to the Cyber Assets baseline configurations.\n",
      "3. Capturing the evidence records\n",
      "4 Scope and Applicability\n",
      "This Cyber Security – Change Control and Configuration Management Process applies to the following categories of ECLRT Cyber Systems and their associated Cyber Assets:\n",
      "1. Operationally Critical\n",
      "2. Safety Critical\n",
      "3. Fire & Life Safety Critical\n",
      "4. Electronic Access Control and Monitoring Systems in DMZ network segments\n",
      "5. Physical Security – Access Control Systems/video surveillance Cyber Systems\n",

      "4.1 Applicability\n",
      "This document applies to the following phases of the ECLRT project:\n",
      "• The effective start date for CTSC’s system testing and commissioning phase, specifically at Commissioning Milestone 3, before starting Stage 4 Integrated System Testing per 0000‐00‐CTSC‐ 70PA‐0002 Commissioning Strategy\n",
      "• During the transition from CTSC testing and commissioning phase and for the duration of CTSC’s project defined “Maintenance Phase” up to the official hand over date of the ECLRT to TTC, as HMQE’s Operator.\n",
      "• This document must be updated and amended for applicability to the CSPSG organization for the ECLRT, at least 100 days prior to the start of ECLRT’s commercial operations or revenue date.\n",
      "4.2 Exclusions\n",
      "This document, does not apply to the following:\n",
      "• Corporate data centers, IT operations centers or other IT hubs containing corporate IT assets.\n",
      "• Corporate/enterprise IT desktops, applications, and corporate business voice/data networks\n",
      "• Cyber Assets or systems that are not part of an ECLRT defined Cyber System or associated Cyber Assets.\n",
      "• Third Party’s systems having external connections to ECLRT Cyber Systems.\n",

    "It seems like we can extract all the information with a good deal of clarity. Combining Unstructured with GPT-4o could prove incredibly useful. Basically, we would extract all the chunks, and then, for all chunks that arent headers or footers, we would pass the elements text property (text_as_html property for tables) to GPT-4o to clean the text for text elements, and summarize the tables for table elements. We would then concatenate all the information into one document, then pass that to GPT-4o to pull Title, Doc type, section headings, topics, authors, revision dates, "
